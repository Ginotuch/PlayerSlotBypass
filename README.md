# PlayerSlotBypass
This plugin has been written specifically for the [Gabbage](https://gabbage.net) minecraft server.

## Permissions
Use a permission manager such as LuckPerms to add permissions to players.
* `playerslot.bypass` lets any player or group with this permission join the server even when it's full.


yep that's all this plugin does
